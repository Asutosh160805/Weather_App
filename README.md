# Weather App

This Weather App provides a real-time weather forecast and city location details. Users can click on the map to get weather information based on the selected coordinates or enter a city name to fetch the weather data. It leverages the OpenWeatherMap API to display weather details like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions such as clear, rainy, cloudy, or snowy. The interface includes an interactive map powered by Leaflet, a weather card that flips to display detailed information, and a dynamic background based on the weather conditions.

## Features

- Displays weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed) dynamically.
- Updates the background and message based on the weather conditions (sunny, rainy, cloudy, snowy).
- Uses a smooth card flip animation to show detailed weather information.
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.
